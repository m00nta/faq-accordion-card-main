## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

For me this was a great introduction to JavaScript and how to select elements and loop over it and do something. Also I used a different approach on the CSS Grid and Flexbox so I am experimenting with this project

### Continued development

I wanna keep experimentig with CSS to see what best suits for styling and I want to practice more my JavaScript skills.
